>  Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations. Few questions are being answered based on exploration and visualisation of the dataset. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and was meant for supervised machine learning, but we're only going to do some exploratory analysis at this stage
